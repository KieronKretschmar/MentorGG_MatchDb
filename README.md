# MatchDb

This project contains the DbContext and Migrations for MatchDb.

The purpose of a MatchDb is to store all information extracted from demo files.

## Migrations
In order to create new migrations, a project with a runtime is required. 
As this repository does not contain one such project, it is recommended to clone [MatchRetriever](https://gitlab.com/mentorgg/csgo/matchretriever) and run migrations there according to [Databases.md](https://gitlab.com/mentorgg/documentation/implementation/blob/master/Databases.md#modifying-the-database-and-creating-migrations).
